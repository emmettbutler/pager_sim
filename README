Memory Paging Simulator
Author: Emmett Butler

This program simulates three different memory paging algorithms across three
different memory access patterns, with configurable disk size, number of variables,
and memory size. Command line arguments can be used to specify these sizes.

Three functions are named f_threadx - each of these functions emulates three
different patterns of variable access.
Three other functions are named page_in_x, each emulating a different paging
algorithm.
fetch() is the routine used to access memory by the three threads
There are also a number of supplementary functions
main() performs initialization and thread creation/termination

FILES:
pagers.c: the source code for the simulation and all supplementary functions
test_pagers: the object file generated by make
Makefile: run make to build project
outputs/: directory of collected outputs from the specified runs of the simulator
    with filename structure <number of variables>-<memory size>
configs: a shell script that runs the five configurations sequentially
